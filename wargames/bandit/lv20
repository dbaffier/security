nmap localhost ( see which ports is open on localhost )


echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p 4242

-p specifies port
-l set in listen mode
print the echo to any clients connected to port 4242


then listen to port 4242 with :

nmap localhost -p 4242

now we get the passwd on the listener :

gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
