ltrace to check if there is an error

we found one on cat

ls -la show aswell that the file leviathan2 is owned by leviathan3 user

so we saw that cat can read multiple files who are separated by space

we can then create one random file and a symlink to leviathan2

call the binary with one file who contain both name of these file separated by
space

get passswd
