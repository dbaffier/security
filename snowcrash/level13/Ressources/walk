gdb ./level13

disas main

we can see this :

 0x08048595 <+9>:	call   0x8048380 <getuid@plt>
 0x0804859a <+14>:	cmp    $0x1092,%eax

it call getuid then check if eax is equal to 4242 (0x1092)

but we're not uid 4242

gdb> b*0x0804859a

gdb> r

gdb> info registers
gdb> set $eax=0x1092
gdb> s

since the cmp is now correct we jump to the right line
