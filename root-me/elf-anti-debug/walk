There is some signal(SIGTRAP, FUNC) at the start multiple times


and there is some handmade \xCC writed which trigger the debugger


we can bypass these with signal SIGTRAP

we can also use catch syscall read, catch syscall write
it give us some code where the addr of buffer read is
if we look next block  we can see some sort of decryptiion below

which do `xor byte, 0xfc` it check for our buffer 0x8048251 and some string 0x80482d1
which correspond to  [A5 CF 9D B4 DD 88 B4 95 AF 95 AF 88 B4 CF 97 B9 85 DD 00]

in python >>> ''.join(map(lambda i: chr(i ^ 0xfc), [0xA5, 0xCF, 0x9D, 0xB4, 0xDD, 0x88, 0xB4, 0x95, 0xAF, 0x95, 0xAF, 0x88, 0xB4, 0xCF, 0x97, 0xB9, 0x85, 0xDD]))
'Y3aH!tHiSiStH3kEy!'
